# House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

This repository contains my solution for the "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" competition on Kaggle. In this competition, the goal is to develop a regression model that accurately predicts the sale prices of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.

## Competition Description

The "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" competition challenges participants to utilize a provided dataset of housing features to build a regression model. The model should accurately predict the sale prices of unseen houses based on their characteristics. The performance of the models is evaluated using the root-mean-square error (RMSE) metric.
